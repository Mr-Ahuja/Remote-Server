If Python is not avalable, you can use simple curl commands to use Upload and Download

Upload
curl -X 'POST' 'https://remote-terminal-mrahuja.herokuapp.com/upload'   -H 'accept: application/json'   -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data'   -F 'file=@test.txt'

Download
curl https://remote-terminal-mrahuja.herokuapp.com/download/test.txt

Note : Heroku refreshes POD and this is a statefull system, means if Pod is refreshed then data will be lost.
If you upload anything, Download ASAP

POD refreshment time is not very short 1-2 hrs data will be persisted but can't garantee
